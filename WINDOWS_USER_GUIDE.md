## üöÄ Three Easy Ways to Run the Battle Simulator

### üéØ Method 1: One-Click Launcher (EASIEST!)

**This is the simplest way - perfect if you're not familiar with programming:**

1. **Download Python** (one-time setup):
   - Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
   - Click "Download Python" (get the latest version)
   - **IMPORTANT**: During installation, check the box "Add Python to PATH"
   - Complete the installation

2. **Run the simulator**:
   - Find the file called `run_simulator.bat` 
   - **Double-click it** - that's it!
   - The first time it runs, it will automatically install everything needed
   - The battle simulator will start automatically

3. **What happens automatically**:
   - ‚úÖ Checks if Python is installed correctly
   - ‚úÖ Downloads and installs required components (pandas, requests)
   - ‚úÖ Starts the battle simulator
   - ‚úÖ Shows helpful error messages if anything goes wrong

### üéØ Method 2: Standalone Executable (BEST FOR SHARING)

**If you want to create a version that works on any Windows computer without Python:**

1. **First, use Method 1 above to get Python installed**

2. **Create the standalone version**:
   - Double-click `run_simulator.bat` once to make sure everything works
   - Open Command Prompt (search "cmd" in Start menu)
   - Navigate to the simulator folder:
     ```
     cd "C:\path\to\your\simulator\folder"
     ```
   - Run this command:
     ```
     python build_exe.py
     ```

3. **Use the standalone version**:
   - You'll find a new file: `dist/BattleSimulator.exe`
   - This .exe file can run on ANY Windows computer
   - No Python installation needed on other computers!
   - Just copy and share the .exe file

### üéØ Method 3: Manual Installation (FOR TECH-SAVVY USERS)

If you're comfortable with command lines:

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```
   pip install pandas requests
   cd "path\to\simulator\folder"
   python simulator.py
   ```

## üìã Quick Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Python is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- **Alternative**: Use Method 2 to create the standalone .exe file

### ‚ùå "Permission denied" or installation errors
- **Solution**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- **Alternative**: The smart launcher uses `--user` installation to avoid this

### ‚ùå Google Sheets not loading
- **Solution**: Check the [Google Sheets Guide](GOOGLE_SHEETS_GUIDE.md) for proper URL format and sharing settings

### ‚ùå Battle simulator crashes or won't start
- **Solution**: Try running `run_simulator.bat` again - it includes error reporting
