- ✅ Automatically checks Python installation
- ✅ Auto-installs missing packages (pandas, requests)
- ✅ Launches the simulator
- ✅ No technical knowledge required!

### Option 2: Standalone Executable (BEST FOR SHARING)
**Run once:** `python build_exe.py`
- 📦 Creates `dist/BattleSimulator.exe` 
- 🎯 **No Python needed on target machines!**
- 📤 Just share the .exe file - that's it!
- 💾 ~50-100MB file size (includes everything)

### Option 3: Manual Setup (FOR DEVELOPERS)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulator.py
```
